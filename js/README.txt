Project location:
./Chapter7/0/project.html

Features implemented:
1. A walking squirrel character with full body animation
2. The character can now turn right or left smoothly like in real life (with animation)
3. Camera mode modified using keys [t,f,g,h], now camera is completely separated from the character and
   are controlled completely separately (so the character can be viewed from any angle).
4. Collision detection with the building is now fully working.
   The character now cannot enter the building while no deadlock bug happens and the character can move back even when hitting the building.
   (Since the coordinate of the building after view transformation needed to be found manually by experiments, the number of building is reduced to 2 just to show it is working)
5. Enemy character added (the pink squirrel) Movement of the enemy is random.
